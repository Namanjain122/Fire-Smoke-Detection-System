# 🔥 Fire and Smoke Detection System using YOLO

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **real-time fire and smoke detection system** built using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection models.  
It was developed during my internship, where it is now **actively deployed** for real-time fire monitoring and safety alerting.

The system can accurately detect fire and smoke in video streams or CCTV footage and trigger alerts to ensure timely response and safety measures.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🚨 **Real-time detection** of fire and smoke using YOLO.
- 📸 Supports **video streams, CCTV feeds, and local video files**.
- 🧩 **Custom-trained YOLO model** with manually labeled dataset.
- ⚡ Optimized for **high accuracy** and **low false alarms**.
- ☁️ **Deployed for production use** in a live environment.
- 🧰 Modular code for easy integration with IoT or alert systems.
