# 🔥 Fire and Smoke Detection System using YOLO

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **real-time fire and smoke detection system** built using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection models.  
It was developed during my internship, where it is now **actively deployed** for real-time fire monitoring and safety alerting.

The system can accurately detect fire and smoke in video streams or CCTV footage and trigger alerts to ensure timely response and safety measures.
